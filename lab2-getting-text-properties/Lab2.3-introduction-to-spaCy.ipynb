    "# Introduction to spaCy\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Whereas NLTK contains separate modules that need to be called indivudally, we now look at another toolkit that hides many steps in one processing module.\n",
    "\n",
    "[spaCy](https://spacy.io/) provides a rather complete NLP pipeline (the output of one module feeds to the input of the next): it takes a raw document and performs tokenization, POS-tagging, stop word recognition, morphological analysis, lemmatization, sentence splitting, dependency parsing and Named Entity Recognition (NER). It also supports similarity prediction, but that is outside of the scope of this notebook. The advantage of spaCy is that it is really fast, and it has a good accuracy. In addition, it currently supports multiple languages, among which: English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian and Dutch. \n",
    "\n",
    "So whereas in NLTK you built your own pipeline, spaCy gives you no choice and does it all for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will show you the basic usage. If you want to learn more, please visit spaCy's website; it has extensive documentation and provides excellent user guides. \n",
    "\n",
    "**at the end of this notebook, you will be able to extract the output from spaCy for the following NLP tasks**:\n",
    "* **Sentence splitting**: attribute **sents** of a `Doc` (of type *spacy.tokens.doc.Doc*)\n",
    "* **Tokenization**: `Doc` contains a sequence of `Token` objects (of type *spacy.tokens.token.Token*)\n",
    "* **Part-of-speech (POS) tagging**: attributes **pos_** and **tag_** of `Token`\n",
    "* **Stop words recognition** attribute **is_stop** of `Token`\n",
    "* **Stemming and lemmatization**: attribute **lemma_** of `Token`\n",
    "* **Constituency/dependency parsing:** attributes **dep_** and **head**\n",
    "* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** attribute **ents** (of type *spacy.tokens.span.Span*) of `Doc` (of type *spacy.tokens.doc.Doc*). \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will be able to use spaCy to visualize the output for each NLP task.\n"

On this page, it is explained exactly how to install spaCy for your operating system, package manager and desired languages.

Alternatively, you can probably also just run the following cells in this notebook:\n",
