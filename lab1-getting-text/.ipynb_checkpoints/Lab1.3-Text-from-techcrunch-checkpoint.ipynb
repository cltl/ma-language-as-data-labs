    "[Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/) is a website with news on tech companies. It is linked to [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com) which contains structured information on tech companies. The TechCrunch site allows you to search on their database. If you type a key word in the search box, e.g. \"apple\", you will see the search results appear; but also the URL address has been changed, e.g.:\n",
