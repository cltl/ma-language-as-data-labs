The CyberShot DSC-HX1 sounds like it will make at least a small splash at the show too, with a 1080p video recording mode and a massive 20x optical zoom at a pocket cam price point. The DSC-HX1 – that’s what we hear it will be called – should look similar to the H50 digicam just with a few extra ‘lumps.’ The source also claims that it will be packing a 3-inch LCD, along with optical SteadyShot, and a 9MP CMOS sensor. We hear that the price is set at 400 pounds but expect the US price to ring in around $400 as well. More to come next week for sure. DPReview \n",

      " Who Gets Rich From Google Buying Nest? Kleiner Returns 20X On $20M, Shasta Nets ~$200M – TechCrunch   Who Gets Rich From Google Buying Nest? Kleiner Returns 20X On $20M, Shasta Nets ~$200M Josh Constine @JoshConstine  /  5 years Google just bought Nest for $3.2 billion cash, and that means the startup’s early investors Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers and Shasta Ventures have struck it rich. Multiple sources say Kleiner invested $20 million in Nest and got a 20X return to pull in $400 million. [Update: Meanwhile, the deal returned “almost all” of Shasta’s second $250M fund.] Nest didn’t disclose the size of its Series A and B rounds or who invested how much. That makes it’s hard to pinpoint who earned what on the sale of the home automation startup that sells smart thermostats and smoke detectors. Shasta and KPCB funded all of Nest’s Series A round back in September 2010, just a few months after the connected device startup was founded. Then in August 2011, they both participated in Nest’s Series B, which also included Google Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Intertrust, and Generation Investment Management. Multiple sources say Kleiner Perkins was Nest’s biggest investor, and was able to invest $20 million in Nest across the A and B rounds. Our sources say the $3.2 billion cash price Google paid for Nest will generate a 20X return for KPCB — which matches the 20X multiple Fortune’s Dan Primack heard from a source. The money came from 2010’s $650 million KPCB XIV fund, which means Kleiner returned over 60% of the fund with just its Nest investment. The treasure should also boost the status of KPCB partner Randy Komisar, who sourced the investments and sat on Nest’s board. The win for Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers is reminiscent of its early home runs on investments in Google, Amazon, AOL, and Intuit in the 1990s. Recently, it’s gotten a piece of huge exits like Facebook and Twitter as well as rising stars like Square and Spotify, but not until later rounds when potential returns are much lower. But with Nest, KPCB got in on the ground floor and will reap the benefits when the acquisition by Google officially closes. Shasta Ventures’ Managing Director Rob Coneybeer, who led its Nest investment As for Shasta Ventures, today is a massive win for the firm and its managing director Rob Coneybeer, who we hear fought relentlessly to get the $250 million Shasta II fund into Nest’s Series A and B rounds. [Update: A source familiar with Google’s deal to acquire Nest tells us Shasta’s investment will bring it enough money to return “almost all” of the $250 million Shasta II fund. That means Shasta pulled in $200 million or more from the Nest acquisition.] The Nest deal almost surely trumps other Shasta hits like Zenprise which was bought by Citrix, and Mint which was bought by Intuit. The returns could bolster confidence in limited partners and help Shasta raise its next fund. Google Ventures also pulled in big money today, as it led Nest’s Series B and C rounds. Oh, and so did Nest’s founders Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers. For the venture capital industry as a whole, the Nest acquisition may contribute to a frothy market for hardware entrepreneurs. If companies like Google are out there paying billions in cash for young startups that build devices instead of software, it may become easier for hardware tinkers to raise serious capital and move from their garage to a real laboratory.

You may remember that it took 22 hours for the iPhone 4S and about 20 hours for the iPhone 4 to sell out of its pre-order, launch-day stock. The iPhone 5 took just about 60 minutes. Yep. One hour after pre-orders went live, Apple.com adjusted shipping expectations from one to two weeks due to the overwhelming demand. Demand for the phone caused problems on Apple’s website and several of the wireless carriers’ sites, as many users were met with error messages when they attempted to pre-order the new iPhone. There’s always plenty of hubbub around Apple product launches, though the pre-order launch of the iPhone 4S came and went without problems on Apple.com or carrier sites. It wouldn’t be surprising if this turns out to be an indication of what’s to come. All summer we were subjected to seemingly endless speculation and rumors regarding every last detail of the new, new iPhone. But, when it was finally unveiled this week, the reviews — which, while still characterized by the usual fanboi excitement — seemed more lukewarm than in years past. Even compared to the recent iPad/Mac event. As is so often the case with Apple, the new phone looks great, with the bigger screen and improved speed ranking as my personal favorites. Yet, that being said, I haven’t yet seen the kind of mind-melting innovation and improvement that would justify pre-orders 20 times faster than the 4 and 4S. Nonetheless, people are still ready to buy it in what will no doubt be massive numbers. “Available to ship: 2 weeks”… man that last week it’s gonna feel like you have an old cement block in your pocket.

The bottom line sits atop everything else. And the bottom line is that, despite the phone not having any of those drastic changes some hoped for (NFC?) and a lack of an overwhelming “wow” factor, so many people went online at midnight or past — on a work night no less — to shell out hundreds of dollars for a pre-order jubilee that had sites crashing and the first batch selling out in 60 minutes. That’s why Apple is the most valuable company in the world. The question is: The iPhone 4S had Siri, which captured our attention in full, even if she’s been a disappointment since … so what feature or tool will be that for the 5?

The 570 is sort of like an SLR, but not. It has a rather large LCD at 2.7-inches and a f2.8-4.5 lens with an equivalent of 26-520mm focal length. I guess the inclusion of manual, aperture and shutter priority modes along with hotshoe would fool some into thinking this is a full fledged DSLR and for good reason. It also snaps photos at 13.5fps. It makes for a perfect step up from point-and-shoots if you’re uncomfortable with DSLRs. All of this can be yours for $499.99. Perfect Shot Preview mode enables users to preview and select various photographic effects (such as zoom, exposure compensation, white balance and metering) on a live, multi-window screen before snapping the shot. Perfect Shot Preview enables users to see precisely what the image will look like when adjustments are made, ensuring users are capturing the exact image they want. It is an ideal way for novice users to learn about the effects of different photography techniques. [photopress:SP_570UZ_2_L.JPG,thumb,pp_image]  [photopress:SP_570UZ_3_L.JPG,thumb,pp_image] \n",

That’s a mighty bold claim, one that Techreport discovered wasn’t quite as it seemed. Although Stanford claims the beta GPU client runs 20 and 40 times faster on new Radeons, and although Radeons have many gigaflops of processing power, the current client doesn’t quite report this tremendous workload. In the test, the GPU client had 2640 work points completed whereas the CPU client only had 899. That’s far removed from the 20~40x reported. What gives? Well actually, the discrepancy comes from the fact taht points and work units are on a different scale depending on whether you’re using CPUs or GPUs. The GPU client is actually doing 20 to 40 times more work, but because the benchmark is set so much higher, the result is that the points are, give or take, not all that much different. So since the scoring scheme doesn’t reflect the bigger workload done, don’t expect to show off your Folding@Home scores to your nerd buddies and brag about how much more cancer research you’re doing. Nevertheless, the GPU is doing an order of magnitude more processing than the CPU. A closer look at Folding@home on the GPU [TechReport] \n",

      " Greg Kumparak – TechCrunch   Greg Kumparak Editor Greg Kumparak is an editor at TechCrunch. Greg started at TechCrunch in May of 2008. He led TechCrunch’s sister site MobileCrunch as editor until AOL acquired the company in 2010, at which point the editors of TechCrunch’s four main sites (TechCrunch, CrunchGear, MobileCrunch, TechCrunch UK) merged the sites under one domain. Best known for his gadget coverage, Kumparak has broken hundreds of stories within the space — unearthing details on everything from abandoned Samsung smartphone prototypes to new Apple  devices. He’s also one of the Internet’s most prolific “live bloggers”, having reported from the scene at dozens of international events for live audiences in the hundreds of thousands. He was one of the earliest writers to highlight and report on a number of companies that have since become “unicorns” (reaching a valuation of $1B or more), including Zenefits and Twilio. Kumparak is a frequent guest on TechCrunch’s Gadget, Apple, and Android podcasts, and often appears on stage as an interviewer or judge at TechCrunch’s meetups and Disrupt conferences. In 2012, Greg was featured on the BBC, Wired, Mashable, Engadget and many other outlets for a side project he called the “tARdis”, or the Augmented Reality TARDIS. By combining augmented reality with a handmade physical model, Greg was able to replicate the otherwise physically impossible “bigger on the inside” visual effect that commonly appears on television’s Doctor Who series. twitter crunchbase-alt The Latest from Greg Kumparak Two years later, I still miss the headphone port Dec 25, 2018 Greg Kumparak Bluetooth?

      " Devialet’s Hi-Tech “Phantom” Implosion Stereo Sounds Better Than Speakers 20X Its Size – TechCrunch   Devialet’s Hi-Tech “Phantom” Implosion Stereo Sounds Better Than Speakers 20X Its Size Josh Constine @JoshConstine  /  4 years You need a big sub-woofer for big bass, right? Wrong. After 10 years of research, French acoustic engineers as Devialet just unveiled a giant step forward in audio that’s just one foot long. The Phantom is a petite, spherical, all-in-one amplifier and speaker that delivers what audiophiles think may be the best sound in the world for around $2,000. Of course, $2,000 is pretty steep, and that’s just for one of these things. But it’s about the same as a 5.1 stereo system from Sonos or a traditional set of hi-fi speakers, sub and amp. When Sting from The Police heard the Phantom, he said “I want people to listen to my music on this.” Hip-hop producer Rick Rubin was amazed by the depth of its bass. And former Beats Music CEO David Hyman said: “This small beautiful object will create a sound in your house that is just staggering. I’ve heard it. Nothing comes close. It can knock your walls down too.”   Devialet has been awarded 77 patents, and has racked up 37 awards for sound and design since its first line of amplifiers launched in 2010.

Wrong. After 10 years of research, French acoustic engineers as Devialet just unveiled a giant step forward in audio that’s just one foot long. The Phantom is a petite, spherical, all-in-one amplifier and speaker that delivers what audiophiles think may be the best sound in the world for around $2,000. Of course, $2,000 is pretty steep, and that’s just for one of these things. But it’s about the same as a 5.1 stereo system from Sonos or a traditional set of hi-fi speakers, sub and amp. When Sting from The Police heard the Phantom, he said “I want people to listen to my music on this.” Hip-hop producer Rick Rubin was amazed by the depth of its bass. And former Beats Music CEO David Hyman said: “This small beautiful object will create a sound in your house that is just staggering. I’ve heard it. Nothing comes close. It can knock your walls down too.”   Devialet has been awarded 77 patents, and has racked up 37 awards for sound and design since its first line of amplifiers launched in 2010.

      " Apple addresses why people are saying their iPhones with older batteries are running ‘slower’ – TechCrunch   Apple addresses why people are saying their iPhones with older batteries are running ‘slower’ Matthew Panzarino @Panzer  /  1 year Because of a Reddit post and the loose interpretation of subsequent benchmark tests posted by Primate Labs’ John Poole, the “Apple throttles old iPhones” meme has reared its ugly head again. The gist, as it always is, is that Apple  is being super petty and trying to force customers to upgrade their phones by making their old phones run slower. As always, the answer is no. It would be beyond stupid and incredibly short-sighted for Apple to do this and, if it was actually true, would likely lead to tangles of a governmental and legal nature that no company like Apple would ever want to happen. Instead, Apple is focusing attention on smoothing out the very high and quick peaks of power draw that can cause problems with older batteries. Here’s a statement that Apple provided when I inquired about the power profile that people were seeing when testing iPhones with older batteries: Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices. Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components.  Last year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. We’ve now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future. The short-form version of what Poole’s benchmarks are showing is the result of a power curve-smoothing algorithm that Apple rolled out last year to mitigate iPhone shutdown issues. I wrote about it here; you can read that and come back. Basically, iPhones were hitting peaks of processor power that the battery was unable to power and the phones were shutting off. Apple then added power management to all iPhones at the time that would “smooth out” those peaks by either capping the power available from the battery or by spreading power requests over several cycles. This is clearly shown in Poole’s charts in his post: Also, to be clear, Poole’s charts appear to be accurate — nor is Apple saying this isn’t happening. Some users who have had older batteries replaced also said they’ve seen improved benchmarks after replacing their batteries. Well, yeah. Of course. As batteries age, they stop working as well. Period. And that age isn’t just about years or charge cycles — heat is a huge killing factor for batteries, for instance. If your iPhone gets left out in the sun a lot or gets hot a bunch, then your battery will kick the bucket a lot sooner. As that battery ages, iOS will check its responsiveness and effectiveness actively. At a point when it becomes unable to give the processor all the power it needs to hit a peak of power, the requests will be spread out over a few cycles. Remember, benchmarks, which are artificial tests of a system’s performance levels, will look like peaks and valleys to the system, which will then trigger this effect. In other words, you’re always going to be triggering this when you run a benchmark, but you definitely will not always trigger this effect when you’re using your iPhone like normal. Apple will continue to add this smoothing to more devices over time to avoid shutdown issues, freezing and other problems. It’s important to note that this is a lithium-ion chemistry issue, not an Apple issue. Batteries just get crappy over time. This is an attempt to make your phone work for longer with less issues, not to get you to switch away from it. Last year, Apple also added a notification for the user when the battery gets to a really rough state, but it’s pretty conservative about that, so it will likely not trigger until well after iOS feels it should start capping the max power draw from batteries. Just as an FYI. Basically, if your phone is cold, has a low battery charge or has an aged battery, it will be unable to supply peak current. Period. I think there’s an argument here that many people will never, ever see this happening. It is applied only when maximum power draw is required of the battery, e.g. when you are doing something intense with your iPhone like playing a game or using 3D applications. But clearly some people are seeing a pervasive triggering of this limiter. This will not affect the average performance of your device, and it is emphatically not throttling; it’s capping the peak demands and not allowing them to be as high — and spreading that work out over more cycles rather than one. However… I think one thing that can be argued here is that there is a balance to be struck between giving people too much information and not enough information. If you give a user enough rope they will hang themselves, so to speak, by replacing batteries too early or replacing phones that don’t need replacing. But, as a matter of transparency, I think that beyond saying very publicly that they are doing this power management (which they have now done twice), there could be an avenue here to be more aggressive and transparent with the user about when their battery is directly affecting the peak performance of their iPhone. “I think users who experience significant slowdowns due to battery wear would want Apple to be more transparent about this issue,” says Poole. “A notification stating that the battery needs service would be a simple way to reduce users’ concerns and help them address this problem.” Roughly, the three points for possible improvement I see here are as follows: Apple should examine whether the gap is too large between when the algorithm starts smoothing out the peaks of performance and when they’re notified that their performance is taking a hit due to battery age. If a person is noticing (and it seems they are, given the discussion threads and social activity on this) that their phone is running slower, then they need to know why. The point at which iOS will tell you that your battery has gone to hell is currently very, very conservative. Perhaps this can be set to be more aggressive. Then, of course, users will complain that Apple is cash-grabbing on battery replacements, but humans will remain humans. It’s clear that people just didn’t understand that protecting an iPhone with an older battery was going to directly affect performance. Perhaps this is a failing of Apple messaging or a failure of myself (and other journalists) in not explaining it as clearly as possible. Largely, I think, the controversy that has hit this week could have been mitigated significantly by Apple having a direct conversation with its users via the device that they’re actually using. I know these things are hard (and I get to say “do it” without actually having to do it), but these kinds of conversations are not always best conducted via a third party. \n",

      " Apple addresses why people are saying their iPhones with older batteries are running ‘slower’ – TechCrunch   Apple addresses why people are saying their iPhones with older batteries are running ‘slower’ Matthew Panzarino @Panzer  /  1 year Because of a Reddit post and the loose interpretation of subsequent benchmark tests posted by Primate Labs’ John Poole, the “Apple throttles old iPhones” meme has reared its ugly head again. The gist, as it always is, is that Apple  is being super petty and trying to force customers to upgrade their phones by making their old phones run slower. As always, the answer is no. It would be beyond stupid and incredibly short-sighted for Apple to do this and, if it was actually true, would likely lead to tangles of a governmental and legal nature that no company like Apple would ever want to happen. Instead, Apple is focusing attention on smoothing out the very high and quick peaks of power draw that can cause problems with older batteries. Here’s a statement that Apple provided when I inquired about the power profile that people were seeing when testing iPhones with older batteries: Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices. Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components.  Last year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. We’ve now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future. The short-form version of what Poole’s benchmarks are showing is the result of a power curve-smoothing algorithm that Apple rolled out last year to mitigate iPhone shutdown issues. I wrote about it here; you can read that and come back. Basically, iPhones were hitting peaks of processor power that the battery was unable to power and the phones were shutting off. Apple then added power management to all iPhones at the time that would “smooth out” those peaks by either capping the power available from the battery or by spreading power requests over several cycles. This is clearly shown in Poole’s charts in his post: Also, to be clear, Poole’s charts appear to be accurate — nor is Apple saying this isn’t happening. Some users who have had older batteries replaced also said they’ve seen improved benchmarks after replacing their batteries. Well, yeah. Of course. As batteries age, they stop working as well. Period. And that age isn’t just about years or charge cycles — heat is a huge killing factor for batteries, for instance. If your iPhone gets left out in the sun a lot or gets hot a bunch, then your battery will kick the bucket a lot sooner. As that battery ages, iOS will check its responsiveness and effectiveness actively. At a point when it becomes unable to give the processor all the power it needs to hit a peak of power, the requests will be spread out over a few cycles. Remember, benchmarks, which are artificial tests of a system’s performance levels, will look like peaks and valleys to the system, which will then trigger this effect. In other words, you’re always going to be triggering this when you run a benchmark, but you definitely will not always trigger this effect when you’re using your iPhone like normal. Apple will continue to add this smoothing to more devices over time to avoid shutdown issues, freezing and other problems. It’s important to note that this is a lithium-ion chemistry issue, not an Apple issue. Batteries just get crappy over time. This is an attempt to make your phone work for longer with less issues, not to get you to switch away from it. Last year, Apple also added a notification for the user when the battery gets to a really rough state, but it’s pretty conservative about that, so it will likely not trigger until well after iOS feels it should start capping the max power draw from batteries. Just as an FYI. Basically, if your phone is cold, has a low battery charge or has an aged battery, it will be unable to supply peak current. Period. I think there’s an argument here that many people will never, ever see this happening. It is applied only when maximum power draw is required of the battery, e.g. when you are doing something intense with your iPhone like playing a game or using 3D applications. But clearly some people are seeing a pervasive triggering of this limiter. This will not affect the average performance of your device, and it is emphatically not throttling; it’s capping the peak demands and not allowing them to be as high — and spreading that work out over more cycles rather than one. However… I think one thing that can be argued here is that there is a balance to be struck between giving people too much information and not enough information. If you give a user enough rope they will hang themselves, so to speak, by replacing batteries too early or replacing phones that don’t need replacing. But, as a matter of transparency, I think that beyond saying very publicly that they are doing this power management (which they have now done twice), there could be an avenue here to be more aggressive and transparent with the user about when their battery is directly affecting the peak performance of their iPhone. “I think users who experience significant slowdowns due to battery wear would want Apple to be more transparent about this issue,” says Poole. “A notification stating that the battery needs service would be a simple way to reduce users’ concerns and help them address this problem.” Roughly, the three points for possible improvement I see here are as follows: Apple should examine whether the gap is too large between when the algorithm starts smoothing out the peaks of performance and when they’re notified that their performance is taking a hit due to battery age. If a person is noticing (and it seems they are, given the discussion threads and social activity on this) that their phone is running slower, then they need to know why. The point at which iOS will tell you that your battery has gone to hell is currently very, very conservative. Perhaps this can be set to be more aggressive. Then, of course, users will complain that Apple is cash-grabbing on battery replacements, but humans will remain humans. It’s clear that people just didn’t understand that protecting an iPhone with an older battery was going to directly affect performance. Perhaps this is a failing of Apple messaging or a failure of myself (and other journalists) in not explaining it as clearly as possible. Largely, I think, the controversy that has hit this week could have been mitigated significantly by Apple having a direct conversation with its users via the device that they’re actually using. I know these things are hard (and I get to say “do it” without actually having to do it), but these kinds of conversations are not always best conducted via a third party. \n",

      " Apple's \"Back To The Mac\" Event Heralds OS X Improvements – TechCrunch   Apple's \"Back To The Mac\" Event Heralds OS X Improvements Devin Coldewey @techcrunch  /  8 years Invitations are going out for Apple’s next event, and it’s looking to be all about the Mac, as opposed to the last few, which have been primarily iOS-related. The only clue we’re given is that we’ll “see what’s new for the Mac on October 20, including a sneak peek of the next major version of Mac OS X.” That doesn’t sound like a 7″ iPad to me. Let’s take a look at the rumors and speculation of recent months and see whether we can’t predict what cards Apple is planning to lay down come the 20th. iMac/MacBook Touch: this rumor has its origins in a patent filing by Apple for a “convertible” device that would switch between OS X and iOS. It was supercharged with rumors of 20+” capacitive touchscreens being shipped to Apple — rumors which were later denied by the company implicated. I don’t think they’d push such a major change to their lineup just before the holidays — if we do ever see this, I see it happening in the first half of next year. New MacBook Air: it’s certainly due for an upgrade, and while few other laptops out there have comparable form factors, this is an area in which Apple would like to stay ahead of the game. I personally would like to see an 11″ version, as rumored, but the truth is that Apple might consider that a netbook form factor, one that would not adequately show off OS X. They’re in a tough spot here; they can’t push the form factor much smaller without compromising their stance on netbooks, and they can’t just keep making incremental improvements or tablets and other, cheaper ultraportables will overtake the Air. This one is anyone’s guess. Processor bumps: It’s time to bring the plastic MacBooks up to date, perhaps with Core i3 processors. The rest of the lineup might get other improvements, like GPU upgrades, SD, maybe even USB 3.0. NVIDIA Optimus: this hybrid graphics technology has seen some major improvements in the last year, and it offers real improvement to battery life. Apple has their own ideas about power management (they use NVIDIA graphics but not Optimus), but being able to dial the GPU up and down seamlessly is likely on their developer wish list. New OS X: That looks like a lion to me. Whether it’s a specific kind of lion, I can’t say for sure. It’s definitely not a cave lion, and the Barbary lion is extinct, so I don’t think they’d use that. I’m going with “regular lion” for OS X 10.7. What will we see? I’m thinking deeper media integration (better internal renderers and such), improved iOS cross-compatibility (iOS dashboard replacing the actual dashboard), and perhaps even the long-awaited ZFS file system? We’ll find out soon, but I do expect a strong iOS component (more on that later). It’s a “sneak peek,” so it won’t be available until… I’m going to say January. iPad news: there’s been a lot of chatter about a possible 7″ iPad, and I believe it, but Apple knows how to put on a presentation — and you don’t lessen the impact of practical things like processor bumps and OS X upgrades by throwing in a flashy product announcement. If they do have a 7″ iPad coming, they will want to announce it closer to the holidays with immediate availability, the better to take advantage of spendy tablet-lovers under the influence of the reality distortion field. I’m going on the record saying that the future of OS X is convergence with iOS, and vice versa. Their mobile operating system is too valuable an asset to not leverage as part of their desktop and laptop properties, and the convertible iOS/OS X devices suggest they’ve been thinking about it for a while. Adding touch to Macs is inevitable, if only because the benefits of making iOS that much more ubiquitous are clear. The trouble is that they can’t show one without implying the other. If Lion has an iOS Dashboard or something like it, the conclusion (touch-based Macs) is inescapable and sales of current non-touch Macs will drop or stagnate since people know what’s coming. It’s just a week away, so we won’t be in agony of expectation for long. \n",

      " Will OS X 10.7 \"Lion\" Be The King Of The Apple Jungle, The Last Of Its Kind, Or Both? – TechCrunch   Will OS X 10.7 \"Lion\" Be The King Of The Apple Jungle, The Last Of Its Kind, Or Both? MG Siegler @mgsiegler  /  8 years As you’re well aware by now, this morning, Apple sent out invites to an event taking place in one week at their headquarters in Cupertino, CA. The invite reads, “Back to the Mac.” and asks those invited to “Come see what’s new for the Mac on October 20, including a sneak peek of the next major version of Mac OS X.” But the most interesting thing about the invite has to be the picture. It’s an Apple logo cut out a sheet of metal that has been slightly turned to reveal what’s behind the sheet: a lion. Apple began using big cat nicknames with initial release of OS X. 10.0 was “Cheetah”, 10.1 was “Puma”, 10.2 was “Jaguar”, 10.3 was “Panther”, 10.4 was “Tiger”, 10.5 was “Leopard”, and the current version, 10.6, is “Snow Leopard”. Initially, these were internal code names at Apple, but they eventually became a part of the marketing for the OS. And it certainly looks like OS X 10.7 is going to be dubbed “Lion”. On the surface, that nickname could easily be discounted as just a random big cat Apple hasn’t used yet. But this is Apple, they don’t do “random”. There are a few big cats left that Apple could have chosen from — Lynx, Cougar (har har), and even Clouded Leopard come to mind — but they’re going with Lion, the kind of the jungle. To me, this means they intend this version of OS X to be big. You might think that’s obvious, but consider OS X 10.6, which they named “Snow Leopard” — an extension of 10.5 “Leopard” — rather than giving it it’s own completely new big cat name. (Technically, snow leopards are from a different genus than leopards, but most people don’t realize that.) And in fact, Snow Leopard wasn’t all that different from Leopard other than it was faster and had a much smaller footprint. And Apple wasn’t afraid to say as much when they unveiled the OS in June 2009. But OS X 10.7 Lion could be a completely revamped OS X, including a long-awaited interface change. The computing world is shifting into the age of mobile, and iOS is now seen as Apple’s major operating system. Perhaps OS X Lion will represent the beginning of a unification between OS X and iOS. And if Apple is giving it the Lion moniker, which they won’t be able to top, perhaps they mean this to be last version of OS X? (Though they do say “next” version of Mac OS X and not “last”.) As we noted back in June, the footprint of OS X 10.7 is already out there. We see it everyday in the TechCrunch logs, undoubtedly from Apple’s HQ where it’s being worked on.

      " Surprise! OS X Mountain Lion Roars Into Existence (For Developers Today, Everyone This Summer) – TechCrunch   Surprise! OS X Mountain Lion Roars Into Existence (For Developers Today, Everyone This Summer) MG Siegler @mgsiegler  /  7 years Confirmed: Apple  can still surprise. On July 20 of last year, Apple began a journey. With OS X  Lion (aka OS X 10.7), the company started taking some of what they had learned from iOS, and the iPad specifically, and putting it in their more mature OS. Today, that transition continues with OS X Mountain Lion. Yes, Apple is already ready to show off the next version of OS X — technically 10.8 — just seven months after the last version was released. Actually, it hasn’t even been a full seven months. But given how quickly iOS development is moving, Apple wants to make sure OS X can keep up. For the past week, I’ve been using an initial demo version of OS X Mountain Lion. To be clear, it’s not quite complete yet, but it’s already fairly polished. With that in mind, Apple will be releasing a developer preview of Mountain Lion today to Mac developers. And the plan is to release the new OS sometime this coming summer. So what’s new? The best way to think of OS X Mountain Lion may be to think back to OS X Snow Leopard (10.6). If you recall, Apple positioned it to be a smaller upgrade to OS X Leopard (10.5), hence the naming convention. My sense is that the same is true here — and again, hence the naming — but Apple isn’t really positioning it that way. Instead, they view it as the next step towards a more unified Apple ecosystem. To be fair, while Snow Leopard mainly focused on improvements in speed and size, Mountain Lion actually packs a bunch of new features. Much like they did with OS X Lion, Apple is focusing on ten key ones (though there are dozens of other changes). I’ll give the rundown of those first. iCloud Apple says there are now over 100 million iCloud accounts. With Lion, iCloud had a number of points of integration. But they were tacked on after the initial release. With Mountain Lion, the connection is much deeper. Actually, from the first screen in the setup assistant, you’ll now be asked to set up iCloud. One key addition is Documents in the Cloud. In iOS 5, apps like Pages take advantage of automatic saving to iCloud. With OS X Mountain Lion, the circle is complete as all documents in the iWork suite of apps will save this way as well. In the Document Library, you’ll actually now see a realtime list of all your documents stored in iCloud sorted by application. And you can create folders of documents simply by dragging one on top of another. Again, very iOS-like. And the editing process between Mountain Lion and iOS 5 is seamless. You can change something on your Mac and almost instantly, the change will happen to an open document in iOS as well. Very nice. Messages This is a new app built right into the OS itself. It technically replaces iChat, but with some tweaks, you can find that old interface as well. But the focus now is on a unified dashboard of all your messages, meaning yes, iMessages as well as IM messages. Heavy iMessage users are going to love this. Apple says there are already over 100 million registered iMessage users and that 26 billion iMessages have been sent since the iOS 5 launch in October. The best elements of iMessages now come over to Messages, including delivery and read receipts. You can drag and drop both photos and videos from OS X to send them to iMessage users on iOS. You can also FaceTime right from within the app. And there’s group messaging. Yes, the good old IM protocols still work as well. You can still hook up AIM, Google Talk, Jabber, and Yahoo Messenger by default. One thing you can’t do is message between the various services to iMessage. So, for example, you can’t send an iMessage to an AIM users and hope to continue that coversation on your phone later. And, of course, SMS won’t work with Messages, it’s iMessage-only. Good news: Apple is actually releasing Messages as a public beta today on Apple.com. The final version will ship with Mountain Lion in the summer. Reminders If you’re using iOS 5, you know what Reminders is — it’s Apple’s to-do list app. Now it’s coming to OS X as a stand-alone app. Previously, these were awkwardly baked into Calendar in OS X, not anymore. As you might imagine, thanks to iCloud, all of your Reminders will stay in sync between iOS and OS X Mountain Lion. Notes Same deal as with Reminders, Apple has taken an iOS app and built a stand-alone OS X version. But the new version is beefed up, you can include photos. And you can pin a note to your desktop (like a sticky note — “Stickies” still exists as a separate app too, FYI). This works with iCloud too, obviously. And yes, Notes has been removed from its former awkward home in the Mail app in OS X. Notification Center One of the hallmark features of iOS has long been Push Notifications, now they’re coming to OS X in Mountain Lion. And to make them manageable, the OS is getting a Notification Center, not unlike the one iOS gained in version 5. The Notfication Center in Mountain Lion resides to the right of any screen you’re on. Hidden by default, you trigger it by hitting the dot-within-a-circle button in the upper right hand side of the menu (or by doing a two-finger swipe on a multi-touch trackpad — though this wasn’t working yet in the version of Mountain Lion that I tested). Doing this will shift your desktop to the left to show all your notifications in a way very similar to iOS. There are also two types of Push Notifications you can get in Mountain Lion: Alerts and Banners. Alerts pop-up and give you the option to “close” or “show”. Banners show up for five seconds in the upper right of your screen then fade away (think: Growl). These notification types are configurable (and you can choose not to receive notifications for any app). In the version of Mountain Lion that I used, only Apple apps (Calendar, Safari, Reminders, Messages, Mail, App Store, and Game Center — more on that in a bit) could receive Push Notifications, but fear not, there is a developer API. This means that all third-party apps will potentially have access to the feature as well — or at least those sold through the Mac App Store, I believe. Share In iOS, it’s easy to share something from just about all of the core apps. In OS X, it hasn’t been. With Mountain Lion, you’ll now see a Share button (the right-facing arrow you’ve see in iOS) in many of the apps. In Safari, for example, you’ll now be able to send any website you’re on with two clicks to Mail or the new Messages app. In other apps, you’ll be able to send directly to AirDrop from the drop-down. And depending on the app, you can do the same for photos, videos, and documents as well. One nice touch is that Share isn’t limited to Apple apps — Apple has worked with Vimeo and Flickr so that you can send videos and pictures to those respective services from the drop-down. And there will also be a developer API for the Share box. Though my understanding here is that this will only be on a per-app basis. Meaning a Facebook app, for example, could include a “share to Facebook” link in the Share button drop-down but only for that app. System-wide sharing options will require dealing with Apple — again, as Vimeo and Flickr did. Long story short, no, Facebook isn’t in the system-wide drop-downs. At least not yet. But another app is… Twitter  Just as with iOS 5, Twitter integration is coming to OS X Mountain Lion as well. And again, this is system-wide, meaning you can share just about anything from anywhere to Twitter with two clicks. If you’ve used the integration in iOS, the Tweet Sheet will look familiar to you. Geotagging will work from here as well. And, of course, attachments. You’ll be able to attach photos, web links, and even Mac App Store links. You’ll be able to sign in to your Twitter account from the settings area in Mountain Lion (technically, it’s under Mail, Contacts & Calendars). However, unlike iOS, I’m told that you won’t be promoted to download the Twitter for Mac client. Instead, Twitter is mainly meant to work in the background for when you want to socially share something. (Meaning there is no built-in way to view your Tweet stream.) But Tweet notifications for @replies and DMs should eventually come into the new Notification Center in Mountain Lion, I’m told. Third-party developers will be able to take advantage of this Twitter integration as well, just as they have been with iOS. And you’ll be able to update your Contacts app with Twitter profile pictures. Game Center As I alluded to before, another app making the jump from iOS to OS X is Game Center. Apple says that their gaming social network now has over 100 million registered users. And there are over 20,000 Game Center-enabled games for iOS. That should get a considerable shot in the arm now that there will be Mac support as well. What’s really promising about Game Center in Mountain Lion is that it’s not just about Mac-to-Mac gaming, it will enabled Mac-to-iPhone, Mac-to-iPad, and Mac-to-iPod touch gaming as well. Obviously, this is going to require game developers to custom tailor their apps for seamless gaming, but I’ve seen it in action — someone playing a racing game on a Mac versus someone on an iPhone — and it works very well. You can probably expect a rush of iOS games being ported to the Mac by this summer. AirPlay Mirroring AirPlay is maybe my favorite feature of iOS right now simply because it seems like it’s magic. You can not only push things like movies to the Apple TV from your iPad or iPhone, you can push your entire iOS experience as well. And with Mountain Lion, you can push your entire OS X experience as well. In the menu area of Mountain Lion, you’ll see a new option to push your entire desktop to an Apple TV via Airplay. This will essentially turn your television inot a massive monitor. I’m told there will be no limit on content that can be pushed, though developers may have the option to block certain content down the road (HBO is an example of one iOS app that doesn’t work with AirPlay, which is lame). There’s resolution matching to 720p HD video. Gatekeeper This is an entirely new security feature in Mountain Lion. While Apple feels like they’ve largely avoided some of the major malware problems out there, they acknowledge that the threat is still very real. With Gatekeeper, they offer a solution. And it’s going to be controversial. Essentially, Gatekepper gives you control over the kind of apps that can be installed on your computer. There will be three options: allow apps from anywhere (the way it works today), allow only Mac App Store apps, allows Mac App Store apps and identified developers. The reason why this will be controversial is because the final option will be the default one. To be clear: this means that by default, you won’t be able to install any app from the web on your machine. Now, hold on for a second. Calm down. You can easily change this in the settings (it’s actually not all that different from Android’s default setting, oddly enough). And the truth is that this is likely to be a good thing for many people who might otherwise download bad apps by accident. Apple is not requiring that all apps go through the Mac App Store (though, again, this is an option), but the Mac App Store + Identified Developers option gives them a way to still offer a higher level of protection to the average user. The other controversial element will be the way you become an “identified developer” — you’ll have to sign up to be a Mac app developer (which is $99 a year). Again, this doesn’t mean you’ll have to sell your software through the Mac App Store — nor will your apps be pre-screened by Apple — but it will make it so Apple can know who you are as a developer. And if they find out one of your apps is bad, they’ll quickly pull your credentials. China Apple is thinking a lot about China. And it’s hard to blame them — it’s the area accounting for their fastest growth. With Mountain Lion, there are a number of new features specially tailored for Chinese users. First, there are improvements around the Chinese input methods. Apple notes that the Chinese language is evolving quickly, so they need to be able to update it quickly for things like word suggestions. And they also now have the ability to mix Chinese and English words (without switching keyboards), which apparently is a popular thing to do. Apple is also integrating the Chinese search engine Baidu, into Safari by default for Chinese users. This makes sense as it’s by far the market leader in that country. Along those lines, they’ve added Tudou and Youku support for video uploads. And they have Sina weibo (sort of the Chinese Twitter) integration for microblogging. And there are several popular Chinese email providers as options in Mail now as well. I’m told these special Chinese features have nothing to do with blocking any kind of information that would otherwise be a part of OS X — though I still wonder if the Twitter integration will fully work, for example. Other Things While the things above are the 10 key new features that Apple is highlighting in Mountain Lion right now, there are dozens more not mentioned. A few of the ones I’ve found so far: A unified search/URL bar in Safari. Yes. YES!!!! (And yes, like Chrome.) A “VIPs” area of Mail to mark your favorite contacts. (Yes, sort of like Priority Inbox for Gmail.) A search box in Launchpad (to see for apps if you have a ton). Better date editing in Calendar (a calendar drop-down finally). A much better way to add/remove widgets in Dashboard (more app-like). There’s a new galaxy background (!). Running “Software Update” now re-directs to the Mac App Store. It’s not clear if that’s the way all updates are going to come from now on or if that’s just due to the preview status of Mountain Lion. AirPlay Mirroring will require an Apple TV software update. Running “Shut Down” and “Restart” now remembers your last-used “Re-open windows” setting (finally). There wasn’t a noticeable difference in real-world use speed between Lion and Mountain Lion. I ran both on a 1.7 GHz MacBook Air with 4GB of RAM. Startup and shutdown speed was noticeably slower with Mountain Lion (but again, this is the first release, that may change). Battery life doesn’t seem to be altered by OS X Mountain Lion versus Lion. If anything, it’s maybe a little better (though the machine was also newer). Apple says that over 19 million copies of Lion have now shipped (including both Mac App Store and new Mac numbers). This means the software makes up about 30 percent of the total OS X user base in under seven months. They say that it took Windows 7 twenty-one months to reach that milestone. Now the next race is on. Microsoft will release the first Windows 8 beta in two weeks at Mobile World Congress. The final software is due out before the end of the year. Apple beat them to the punch with the Mountain Lion preview. And they should beat them to the punch with the release this summer as well. (No word on the exact price of OS X Mountain Lion just yet, but Apple says it will be very competitive, just as Lion was — Lion was just $29.99. As you might expect, Mountain Lion will also be distributed exclusively through the Mac App Store.) If the initial developer preview is any indication, Mountain Lion won’t be as big of a sea change as Windows 8 will be. Instead, it’s more of a continuation of what Lion started. Apple has far more iOS users than OS X users at this point. Now it’s about getting everyone on the same page. This early build is a great start.

      " Surprise! OS X Mountain Lion Roars Into Existence (For Developers Today, Everyone This Summer) – TechCrunch   Surprise! OS X Mountain Lion Roars Into Existence (For Developers Today, Everyone This Summer) MG Siegler @mgsiegler  /  7 years Confirmed: Apple  can still surprise. On July 20 of last year, Apple began a journey. With OS X  Lion (aka OS X 10.7), the company started taking some of what they had learned from iOS, and the iPad specifically, and putting it in their more mature OS. Today, that transition continues with OS X Mountain Lion. Yes, Apple is already ready to show off the next version of OS X — technically 10.8 — just seven months after the last version was released. Actually, it hasn’t even been a full seven months. But given how quickly iOS development is moving, Apple wants to make sure OS X can keep up. For the past week, I’ve been using an initial demo version of OS X Mountain Lion. To be clear, it’s not quite complete yet, but it’s already fairly polished. With that in mind, Apple will be releasing a developer preview of Mountain Lion today to Mac developers. And the plan is to release the new OS sometime this coming summer. So what’s new? The best way to think of OS X Mountain Lion may be to think back to OS X Snow Leopard (10.6). If you recall, Apple positioned it to be a smaller upgrade to OS X Leopard (10.5), hence the naming convention. My sense is that the same is true here — and again, hence the naming — but Apple isn’t really positioning it that way. Instead, they view it as the next step towards a more unified Apple ecosystem. To be fair, while Snow Leopard mainly focused on improvements in speed and size, Mountain Lion actually packs a bunch of new features. Much like they did with OS X Lion, Apple is focusing on ten key ones (though there are dozens of other changes). I’ll give the rundown of those first. iCloud Apple says there are now over 100 million iCloud accounts. With Lion, iCloud had a number of points of integration. But they were tacked on after the initial release. With Mountain Lion, the connection is much deeper. Actually, from the first screen in the setup assistant, you’ll now be asked to set up iCloud. One key addition is Documents in the Cloud. In iOS 5, apps like Pages take advantage of automatic saving to iCloud. With OS X Mountain Lion, the circle is complete as all documents in the iWork suite of apps will save this way as well. In the Document Library, you’ll actually now see a realtime list of all your documents stored in iCloud sorted by application. And you can create folders of documents simply by dragging one on top of another. Again, very iOS-like. And the editing process between Mountain Lion and iOS 5 is seamless. You can change something on your Mac and almost instantly, the change will happen to an open document in iOS as well. Very nice. Messages This is a new app built right into the OS itself. It technically replaces iChat, but with some tweaks, you can find that old interface as well. But the focus now is on a unified dashboard of all your messages, meaning yes, iMessages as well as IM messages. Heavy iMessage users are going to love this. Apple says there are already over 100 million registered iMessage users and that 26 billion iMessages have been sent since the iOS 5 launch in October. The best elements of iMessages now come over to Messages, including delivery and read receipts. You can drag and drop both photos and videos from OS X to send them to iMessage users on iOS. You can also FaceTime right from within the app. And there’s group messaging. Yes, the good old IM protocols still work as well. You can still hook up AIM, Google Talk, Jabber, and Yahoo Messenger by default. One thing you can’t do is message between the various services to iMessage. So, for example, you can’t send an iMessage to an AIM users and hope to continue that coversation on your phone later. And, of course, SMS won’t work with Messages, it’s iMessage-only. Good news: Apple is actually releasing Messages as a public beta today on Apple.com. The final version will ship with Mountain Lion in the summer. Reminders If you’re using iOS 5, you know what Reminders is — it’s Apple’s to-do list app. Now it’s coming to OS X as a stand-alone app. Previously, these were awkwardly baked into Calendar in OS X, not anymore. As you might imagine, thanks to iCloud, all of your Reminders will stay in sync between iOS and OS X Mountain Lion. Notes Same deal as with Reminders, Apple has taken an iOS app and built a stand-alone OS X version. But the new version is beefed up, you can include photos. And you can pin a note to your desktop (like a sticky note — “Stickies” still exists as a separate app too, FYI). This works with iCloud too, obviously. And yes, Notes has been removed from its former awkward home in the Mail app in OS X. Notification Center One of the hallmark features of iOS has long been Push Notifications, now they’re coming to OS X in Mountain Lion. And to make them manageable, the OS is getting a Notification Center, not unlike the one iOS gained in version 5. The Notfication Center in Mountain Lion resides to the right of any screen you’re on. Hidden by default, you trigger it by hitting the dot-within-a-circle button in the upper right hand side of the menu (or by doing a two-finger swipe on a multi-touch trackpad — though this wasn’t working yet in the version of Mountain Lion that I tested). Doing this will shift your desktop to the left to show all your notifications in a way very similar to iOS. There are also two types of Push Notifications you can get in Mountain Lion: Alerts and Banners. Alerts pop-up and give you the option to “close” or “show”. Banners show up for five seconds in the upper right of your screen then fade away (think: Growl). These notification types are configurable (and you can choose not to receive notifications for any app). In the version of Mountain Lion that I used, only Apple apps (Calendar, Safari, Reminders, Messages, Mail, App Store, and Game Center — more on that in a bit) could receive Push Notifications, but fear not, there is a developer API. This means that all third-party apps will potentially have access to the feature as well — or at least those sold through the Mac App Store, I believe. Share In iOS, it’s easy to share something from just about all of the core apps. In OS X, it hasn’t been. With Mountain Lion, you’ll now see a Share button (the right-facing arrow you’ve see in iOS) in many of the apps. In Safari, for example, you’ll now be able to send any website you’re on with two clicks to Mail or the new Messages app. In other apps, you’ll be able to send directly to AirDrop from the drop-down. And depending on the app, you can do the same for photos, videos, and documents as well. One nice touch is that Share isn’t limited to Apple apps — Apple has worked with Vimeo and Flickr so that you can send videos and pictures to those respective services from the drop-down. And there will also be a developer API for the Share box. Though my understanding here is that this will only be on a per-app basis. Meaning a Facebook app, for example, could include a “share to Facebook” link in the Share button drop-down but only for that app. System-wide sharing options will require dealing with Apple — again, as Vimeo and Flickr did. Long story short, no, Facebook isn’t in the system-wide drop-downs. At least not yet. But another app is… Twitter  Just as with iOS 5, Twitter integration is coming to OS X Mountain Lion as well. And again, this is system-wide, meaning you can share just about anything from anywhere to Twitter with two clicks. If you’ve used the integration in iOS, the Tweet Sheet will look familiar to you. Geotagging will work from here as well. And, of course, attachments. You’ll be able to attach photos, web links, and even Mac App Store links. You’ll be able to sign in to your Twitter account from the settings area in Mountain Lion (technically, it’s under Mail, Contacts & Calendars). However, unlike iOS, I’m told that you won’t be promoted to download the Twitter for Mac client. Instead, Twitter is mainly meant to work in the background for when you want to socially share something. (Meaning there is no built-in way to view your Tweet stream.) But Tweet notifications for @replies and DMs should eventually come into the new Notification Center in Mountain Lion, I’m told. Third-party developers will be able to take advantage of this Twitter integration as well, just as they have been with iOS. And you’ll be able to update your Contacts app with Twitter profile pictures. Game Center As I alluded to before, another app making the jump from iOS to OS X is Game Center. Apple says that their gaming social network now has over 100 million registered users. And there are over 20,000 Game Center-enabled games for iOS. That should get a considerable shot in the arm now that there will be Mac support as well. What’s really promising about Game Center in Mountain Lion is that it’s not just about Mac-to-Mac gaming, it will enabled Mac-to-iPhone, Mac-to-iPad, and Mac-to-iPod touch gaming as well. Obviously, this is going to require game developers to custom tailor their apps for seamless gaming, but I’ve seen it in action — someone playing a racing game on a Mac versus someone on an iPhone — and it works very well. You can probably expect a rush of iOS games being ported to the Mac by this summer. AirPlay Mirroring AirPlay is maybe my favorite feature of iOS right now simply because it seems like it’s magic. You can not only push things like movies to the Apple TV from your iPad or iPhone, you can push your entire iOS experience as well. And with Mountain Lion, you can push your entire OS X experience as well. In the menu area of Mountain Lion, you’ll see a new option to push your entire desktop to an Apple TV via Airplay.

There’s resolution matching to 720p HD video. Gatekeeper This is an entirely new security feature in Mountain Lion. While Apple feels like they’ve largely avoided some of the major malware problems out there, they acknowledge that the threat is still very real. With Gatekeeper, they offer a solution.

      " Report: Apple Could Sell 28 Million iPads in 2011, Affect Lower-End Notebook Sales – TechCrunch   Report: Apple Could Sell 28 Million iPads in 2011, Affect Lower-End Notebook Sales Matt Burns @mjburnsy  /  8 years The investment researchers all agree: Apple is going to move a crapton of iPads next year. A UBS report states it could be as high as 28 million while others as Ben Reitzes, an analyst with Barclays Capital, thinks 20 million is more likely. Either way, that’s a lot of iOS devices that will likely steal some PC sales. These reports go on to explain the somewhat obivous side effect of selling 20 million or more iPads in that a lot of the sales have to come from somewhere else. Many if not most of the buyers would no doubt have explored other low-cost computing options before ending up with the iPad. Chances are lower-end PC sales are going to suffer if these reports turn out to be accurate. And in many cases, the iPad might be the perfect fit for these consumers. Generally there are two types of consumers looking at low-cost computers: budget-minded people looking for a full computing experience on the cheap and those that simply want a computer for games and communication. Obviously the iPad will not appeal to the first type but for those people that just want something to pass the time, the iPad despite it’s fundamental flaws is just about perfect. These are the folks that will likely opt for the iPad over other low-cost options. Apple managed to sell over 3 million in the first couple months of the iPad’s life. A good chunk of those consumers bought the iPad without even touching it so don’t think for a minute that Apple’s sales are going to slow down when the second generation hits, and the consumer market is already familiar with the device and form factor. The iPad is clearly on its way to be the iPod of the tablet market. \n",

      " The JVC GZ-HM340 camcorder offers HD recording for only $499 – TechCrunch   The JVC GZ-HM340 camcorder offers HD recording for only $499 Matt Burns @mjburnsy  /  9 years High-definition camcorders are constantly falling in price and we like it. The new JVC  GZ-HM340 carries a $499 MSRP but yet offers a lot of what we look for in an HD cam. The model sports image stabilization on a 20x  Konica Minolta HD zoom lens, along with storing the video to either a SD/SDHC card or its internal 16GB flash memory. But what, there’s more! Now, this is a budget HD cam so while it doesn’t have a 3CCD sensor or fancy-pants mics, it does have one touch uploads to YouTube HD, which is actually a somewhat cool feature. It’s also equipped with the ever-popular face detection and thumbnail view modes and the whole thing is controlled through JVC’s Laser Touch Operation bar on the side of the LCD screen. The GZ-HM340 should hit shelves later this month for $499. Not bad, eh? Contacts: Chelsea Vander Groef JVC U.S.A. 973-317-5000, X5312 cvandergroef@jvc.com JVC News Hotline 1-877-NEWS-JVC JVCPR@PlannedTVArts.com JVC ADDS A NEW HIGH DEFINITION MEMORY CAMERA TO EVERIO LINE New GZ-HM340 features 16GB of internal memory. WAYNE, NJ, February 2, 2010 – JVC has added a new high definition camera to its recently-announced 2010 Everio line, giving the series three HD models priced under $500. The new Everio GZ-HM340 features 16GB of internal flash memory plus an SD/SDHC card slot. The GZ-HM340 includes all of the new features and improvements found throughout the 2010 Everio line, including advancements in low light capabilities and image stabilization, while convenience is enhanced with a new auto recording feature and time lapse recording. For a steadier picture, JVC this year introduced Advanced Image Stabilizer (A.I.S) that ensures steady images even while walking, and is especially effective when shooting bright scenes from full wide to 5x zoom. Available on all models, Advanced Image Stabilizer uses a wide-angle image sampling area that is four times larger than that of conventional systems. A.I.S delivers powerful compensation for camera shake. Time-Lapse recording is a sophisticated but easy-to-use feature for time-lapse shooting in one- to 80-second intervals, enabling hours-long segments to be reduced to seconds, such as the continuous recording of changing sky patterns spanning an entire day. Auto record, a new feature, automatically initiates recording when a person or other moving subject enters the picture and the luminance changes, a great convenience for home surveillance, monitoring a baby, recording wildlife, taking group shots (instead of using a self-timer) and more. Digital files created with the new Everio cameras can be easily shared in a variety of popular formats with the enhanced Everio MediaBrowser software for Windows®, which now provides automatic conversion of HD and SD videos for immediate sharing on YouTube™, including both down-conversion and up-conversion. Files can also be directly exported to iTunes® and synced with an iPod® or iPhone®, or burned to DVD, all with just a few mouse clicks using the Everio MediaBrowser application. Like all 2010 HD Everio cameras, the new GZ-HM340 features a KONICA MINOLTA HD LENS, currently one of the world’s smallest and slimmest HD lenses. In the GZ-HM340 it offers a 20x optical zoom. Everio high-definition models automatically switch between two internal media for continuous, uninterrupted recordings. Users can shoot seamless, drop-out-free recordings using dual SD cards or flash memory. HD-model enhancements also include Face Flow Thumbnail, which displays thumbnails from a particular section of a video by automatically selecting and zooming into human faces. The 2010 Everio series features an all new, slim design that’s fashionable, easy to carry and comfortable to hold. Portability has been further enhanced with a redesigned grip belt that now works in two handy ways, as a conventional handle-style grip when both ends are snapped in place or as a strap when one end of the belt is released. The new Everio GZ-HM340 is available later this month for $499.95. Features: 16GB Internal Flash Memory and SD/SDHC card slot 1/5.8″ 1.37 Megapixel CMOS Sensor 20x Optical Zoom (KONICA MINOLTA HD LENS Advanced Image Stabilizer Time-Lapse REC & Auto REC One Touch Upload to YouTube™* (HD Compatible) Seamless Recording over two media Face Detection & Face Flow Thumbnail Laser Touch Operation 2-Way Grip Belt Everio MediaBrowser Color: Black About JVC U.S.A.

Apple released Lion  on July 20, adding new iOS-like features to the OS operating system and improving system performance. To put this into perspective, Apple sold that number over three months while Microsoft sold 240 million copies of Windows 7 in 2010, or about 20 million a month.

Cook said that the “the MacBook Pro and iMac are the number one best selling notebook and desktop in the US. This momentum is not just limited to a mode.
