    "In LAB 1 we are going to explore different ways to access online data. Obviously, not all data can be accessed online. Facebook pages may be private and a lot of data may be hidden in databases, either not public or using an idiosyncratic API. Furthermore, data that can be accessed now using tooling may not be accessible tomorrow. The API may change or licenses restrict the access.\n",
