    "In Lab4, we are going to extract events from text. There are many different ways in which we can define events. In general, we can see that an event can be defined by the answers to the questions *what* happened, *who* was involved, *where* and *when* did it happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "A linguistic way is to start from the syntactic structure of sentences and clauses. The semantic head of the verb phrase denotes the *what*, while the subject and objects represent the *who* (also called participants). The *where* and *when* are commonly expressed through adjuncts (prepositional phrases, adverbs and sometimes noun phrases). Obviously, this is a gross simplification as we find many different ways of packaging events. This approach is also very driven by syntax. For one thing, also nouns can express events as in:\n",

    "```Vaccination causes autism```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the subject and object of the sentence are actually referring to events and the verb *causes* relates these.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to look at events is to see them as conceptual schema that we activate through language expressions. This approach is followed by the FrameNet project, which produced over a thousand of such schemas and a lexicon that maps words to these schemas.\n",
